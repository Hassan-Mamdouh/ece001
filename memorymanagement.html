<h2>Memory Management</h2>
<p>Memory management is the functionality of an operating system that handles or controls primary memory, which during execution moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk.It keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of whether it's allocated to some process or free.It checks how much memory to allocate to processes.It decides at what time which process will get the memory.Whenever some memory is freed or unallocated, it tracks and updates the status correspondingly.</p>

    <th>Memory Addresses</th>
    <th>Description</th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Symbolic addresses</td>
    <td>The addresses that were used in the source code. The variable names, constants and labels of instructions are the basic elements of the space of the symbolic address.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Relative addresses</td>
    <td>A compiler converts symbolic addresses to relative addresses at compilation time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Physical addresses</td>
    <td>At the time a program is loaded into main memory the loader generates these addresses.</td>
