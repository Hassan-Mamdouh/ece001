<h2>File System</h2>
<p>A file is a collection of related information named for secondary storage, such as magnetic disks, magnetic tapes, and optical disks. A file is generally a sequence of bits, bytes, lines, or records whose meaning is defined by the creator and user of the files.</p>
<h3>File Structure</h3>
<p>A File Structure should be in accordance with the required format that the OS can understand.</p>
  <li>A file has a certain structure which is defined by its type.</li>
  <li>A text file is a sequence of lines organized into characters.</li>
  <li>A source file is a sequence of functions and procedures.</li>
  <li>An object file is a sequence of bytes which are organized into blocks which the machine may understand.</li>
  <li>As different file structures are defined by the operating system, it also contains the code to support the file structure. Unix, MS-DOS support minimum file structure number.</li>
<h3>File Type</h3>
<p>File type refers to the operating system's ability to distinguish different file types such as source files from text files and binary files etc. Many operating systems support a great many file types. MS-DOS and UNIX operating systems have the following file types −</p>

  <tr>
    <td><li>These are all the files that include user information.</li>
    <li>These may have text, databases, or program executable.</li>
    <li>Various operations can be applied to such files as adding, modifying, deleting or even removing the entire file.</li></td>
    <td><li>These files contain a list of the names of the files and other information relating to them.</li></td>
    <td><li>These files are also referred to as device files.</li>
    <li>These files are physical devices such as disks, terminals, printers, networks, tape drives, etc.</li>
    <p>These files are of two types:</p>
    <li>Special character files: the data is handled by character, as in the case of terminals or printers.</li>
    <li>Block special files: data is handled in blocks as in the case of disks and tapes.</li></td>
