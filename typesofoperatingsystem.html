<h2>Types of Operating System</h2>
<p>There are many types of Operating System, but we will discuss in some details three of them, which are; Network operating system, time-sharing operating system and Distributed operating system.</p>

  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Definition</th> 
    <th>Advantages</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Network operating System</td>
    <td>It runs on a server and provides the server the capability to control data, users, groups, security, applications and other networking functions.</td>
    <td><li>Centralized servers are highly stable.</li>
    <li>Security is managed on computer.</li>
    <li>NewÂ technologies and hardware upgrades can be easily integrated into the system.</li>
    <li>Different locations and types of systems allow remote access to servers.</li></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Time-sharing operating systems</td>
    <td>Time-sharing is a technique that allows several users to jointly use a particular computer system, located at various terminals.</td>
    <td><li>Provides the quick response advantage.</li>
    <li>Avoids software duplication.</li>
    <li>Decreases CPU idle time.</li></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Distributed operating System</td>
    <td>Distributed systems use several central processors to serve various applications and multiple users in real time. Data processing jobs are also distributed among the processors.</td>
    <td><li>Through the facility of resource sharing, an user at one site can be able to use the available resources at another.</li>
    <li>Speed up data exchange via electronic mail with one another.</li>
    <li>In a distributed system, if one site fails, the remaining sites can potentially continue operating.</li>
    <li>Better service to the customers.</li>
    <li>Load reduction on host computer.</li>
    <li>Reduction of the data processing delays.</li></td>
